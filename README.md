Features Breakdown
1. Create Notes:
The CreateArea component provides input fields for the user to enter a title and content. When the user submits the form, the data is passed to the parent component via props to update the note list.

2. Responsive Design:
The app's layout is built using responsive design techniques, ensuring that the app is usable across all screen sizes. Bootstrapâ€™s grid system or Tailwind CSS classes are used to make the app look great on both desktop and mobile devices.

3. Reusable Components:
The app is split into modular components that are reusable:

CreateArea: Handles the creation of notes.

Note: Displays each individual note.

Footer: Displays additional information like copyrights or links.

4. State Management:
The app uses the useState hook to manage and update the state of notes, including titles and content. Whenever a new note is added, the state is updated and passed down to the component responsible for displaying the notes.

5. Form Validation:
The app ensures that users do not submit empty notes. Before submitting, it checks if both the title and content are empty. If they are, the app prompts the user to enter a valid note.

6. Props for Data Passing:
Data is passed between components using props. For example, the CreateArea component sends the created note to the parent component using the onAdd function passed as a prop.

7. Impressive UI/UX Design:
The app is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly. It uses Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to create a clean and modern look. The app is also styled with clear spacing, intuitive controls, and easy navigation.
